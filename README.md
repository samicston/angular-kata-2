[Code Kata Definition](http://codekata.com/)

Kata:

1. Samuel will create before the Kata a websocket server that is accessible by everybody that will participate in the kata(everybody should be able to connect to it)

2. Every participant should connect to the socket server and push a string message to it and everyone will see it.

3. Split into two teams and make it such a way when one push a string message, it is seen only by his team.

We will play, have fun and explain our good and bad approaches.
